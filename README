######################### 

This package contains the programs and specifications of building the
CVM etree database for the LA basin. There are three directories:
    
    libsrc/      contains the etree library souce code programs.
    examples/    contains example programs demonstrating how to use 
                 the etree library.
    cvm/         contains the programs and specifications of building 
                 cvm etree database for the LA basin.

In each of these directories, there is a README file that explains the

1. How to build the package
###########################

Step 1. Run 'configure' that is in the top-level source directory.
Step 2. Run 'make'.
Step 3. RUn 'make install'.

You may optionally choose to build the examples. The steps are similar
to that of building the etree library except for a different directory.

To build the programs for building the CVM etree database for the LA basin.

Step 1: Enter cvm/ directory.
Step 2: Read the README file. This is important. You need the instruction in
        README to set the variables correctly in the Makefile.
Step 3: Modify the variables in Makefile properly as instructed.
Step 4: Build the programs and etree database as per the instructions.
